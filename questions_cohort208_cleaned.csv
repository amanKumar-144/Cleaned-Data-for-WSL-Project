100956,"First the question: You know that two types of errors can occur during hypothesis testing — namely Type-I and Type-II errors — whose probabilities are denoted by α and β respectively. For the current hypothesis test conditions (sample size, mean, and standard deviation), the value of α and β come out to 0.05 and 0.45 respectively. Now, a different sampling procedure is proposed so that when the same hypothesis test is conducted, the values of α and β are controlled at 0.15 each. Explain under what conditions would either method be more preferred than the other. Since many people still have a doubt regarding this question, here is a concise explanation of what you need to do. You are doing the hypothesis test using 2 sets of alpha and beta. In one case you have alpha =0.05 and beta=0.45. In the other case, you have alpha = 0.15 and beta=0.15 Your task is to explain a situation where either method would be more preferred than the other. So basically explain a situation where conducting the hypothesis test using alpha=0.05 and beta=0.45 is better than conducting the same test using alpha =0.15 and beta=0.15. Similarly, explain a situation where conducting the hypothesis test using alpha=0.15 and beta=0.15 would be better than conducting the same test using alpha=0.05 and beta=0.45 You don't have to bother about the sample conditions(sample size, standard deviation,etc.).

101131,"Let&#39;s say you are a doctor and you approach the scene of a car accident. One victim is lying motionless on the road and you must assess whether the victim is dead or alive, and the victim will be treated accordingly. Based on this information which error (type I or type II) results in the costliest mistake? Let&#39;s try to figure it out. Null Hypothesis - The victim&#39;s status equals a living person. Alternative Hypothesis - The victim&#39;s status is not equivalent to a living person (i.e., victim is dead). Type I error - You reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is actually true. Type II error - You fail to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. Cost of Type I error - You erroneously presume that the victim is dead, and do not give him the life-saving medical treatment. Cost of Type II error - You erroneously send a dead person to the hospital in an ambulance. We know that type I and type II errors are inversely related to each other, i.e., if we increase the probability of type I error type II error will decrease and vice-versa. Now, let&#39;s check the cost of errors for both the scenarios: 1) Type I error increases &amp; Type II error decreases If type I error increases, it means that there is more possibility that if an accident occurs you will presume that the victim is dead and do not provide the victim life-saving medical treatment. This is a very costly mistake/error because it is costing someone&rsquo;s life. At the same time in this scenario you want to decrease Type II error which means you want to be very sure that you are not taking a dead person to the hospital. 2) Type II error increases &amp; Type I error decreases If type II error increases, it means there is high possibility that you will take a dead person to the hospital. At the same time, you are decreasing the type I error which means you want to very sure before declaring a person to be dead and not giving him/her the necessary life-saving medical treatment.",318730

I sense a flaw in this discussion because we haven&#39;t yet actually looked at unaggregated values of sales against unaggregated values of profits to comment on how sales and profit fare against each other.

102759,"tl;dr: Matplotlib is better than Seaborn when it comes to customizing capacity and the ability to produce beautiful visualizations. When I started out with DataViz in Python, I thought that the libraries offered in Python couldn't compare to those offered by R. With ggplot2, R beat a lot of the data science languages easily. And, with easy integration of high-quality plots provided by the package into documents (.docx and pdfs) through RMarkdown, it even competed with LaTex. But, this view recently changed when I came across seaborn in Python. Seaborn (which I'll refer to as sns now onwards), can produce beautiful plots, very quickly. But, sns is built on matplotlib (which I'll refer to as mpl). So, mpl must be able to produce the same thing too. But, it takes more lines of code to produce a scatter plot facetted by a binary categorical variable using mpl than it does using sns. So, sns is easier. Or that's what I thought. I recently worked on a project (which you can find: here https://github.com/krishnamurthypranesh/studious-spork) where DataViz was the most important component. There, I found that using mpl allowed me to modify my plots to my liking while sns limited that capacity. And, when it did offer customizations, it was through mpl.pyplot methods. So, here's what I think: Seaborn is a great library that can be used to rapid-prototype EDA. But, when it comes to producing plots that capture one's attention, matplotlib is the go-to library. What do you think? I'd be glad to hear your opinions.",306733

Then we finally assign cluster IDs to each row. After that we do bar graphs, where we get mean for each feature and under each feature for each cluster. What do we infer from these bar plots (with means)? How to get actionable insights from these? The x-labels of bar plots represent cluster ID - how do we get to know countries belonging to each cluster?",308437

111888,The topic of outlier has been discussed to death and we have been told to focus less on that; and that to drop outliers after doing PCA and choosing n number of PCAs. Dropping outliers makes me very uncomfortable considerring all these are real data and important data as it decides which country gets financial aid and helps the wellbeing of the country (as opposed to just say financial transactions). So say I drop Nigeria because it is an outlier (based on say dropping data that are more than 2 SDs away from the mean for each PC). Say It is outlier on 3 of the 4 chosen PCs whereby it is more than than minus 2 SDs from the mean. Does that not mean that I am possibly dropping a country (Nigeria) that needs financial aid the most just because it is an outlier in 1 or more PCs?? I find that disturbing. I personally would not want to drop any outlier countries as these are all real meaningful and high impact data. Please advise.,300694

Now since we were not given Total population how could we have calculated GDP. And since we could not have calculated GDP then on what basis we should have converted Exports, Health and Imports into their absolute values. In the solution they have calculated absolute values based on GDPP. What is the point of converting exports variable into absolute values using GDPP despite of not having total population values.

Can we just use the training set from PCA (Which has been transformed) and input that into LR and then split that into train and test for LR? Other option would be to also transform the test DF for PCA. Then concat PCA Train and PCA test (lets call that PCA DF). Then split PCA DF into train and test for LR .. We would prefer option 1 as we would still have 80% of the high value customers and then we can again do a 80/20 split of this for LR.,300694

If we do not get marks at all for partial correct answers then the following assertion must be wrong. But if we do get marks for partially correct answers the following must be true. I was attempting a graded coding question and on the start of the page what I see is the following: This means if we solve the question in first attempt, we get 100% based upon the number of testcases we clear. If we solve in second attempt then we get 50% of the total marks. I have a scenario and want to know whether is this the correct method to calculate the final score of the answer. Let's suppose if we have 4 testcases and after submitting following happens: In the first submit 3 out of 4 test cases gets passed. Thus we score 7.5 out of 10 based upon the image above In the second submit 4 test cases pass but as mentioned in the above image, even if I cleared all the testcases in the second attempt but my scores would 50% only i.e 5 out of 10.

99284,"Since many people have some doubts regarding how the Z* is calculated for confidence intervals and how they're different, here is a short summary that explains both the points. First, let's see the difference between the two. We'll be using the same confidence level of 95.4% as explained in the video. If you find the Z-value and Z* for 95.4% probability, both will yield different results as shown in the figure. As you can see in the above image, even though the area covered by both amounts to a 95.4% probability, the calculated Z-values/Z* don't match since the intervals are different. Z-value or Z-score uses the cumulative probability and finds z such that P(Z&lt;z)=95.4% which in this case comes out to be 1.685. Z* is calculated a bit differently that P[-Z*&lt;X&lt;Z*] = 95.4% and in this case Z* comes out to be about 2. Thus there is a clear difference between the two. So you just can't go and check the confidence level % in the Z-table and report back the value as it would give the wrong answer of 1.685 instead of 2 in this case. And this is where you need to find the cumulative probability associated with the given confidence level and find that probability's corresponding Z-score which would be this confidence level's Z*. For example, let's say the confidence level is y%. Now check the image below. By using the symmetry of the normal distribution, we see that the Z* associated with a y% confidence level is equal to the Z-score associated with the cumulative probability of ((100-y)/2 +y )%. Hence you need to just calculate the previously mentioned value and report back its Z-score. It would be the same as the Z* for the confidence level being asked. We can verify this by taking y=95.4 Thus the corresponding cumulative probability would be (100-95.4)/2 + 95.4 = 97.7%. If you check the tables for Z-value corresponding to 0.977 probability you'll get the value of z as 2. Thus 2 is the Z* for the original confidence level",313517
99169,"in the lecture video it was explained that the 95.4% probability is also the confidence level. Whereas in the FAQ section, while explaining Z*, it was explained that first the confidence level needs to be converted to probability. Example shared was that y=95% confidence level, probability is 0.975 or 97.5%. Thus the Conf. level is not equal to probability and here seems to be a conflict beltween these 2 statements...what&#39;s the correct interppretation?",310509

However, in the actual calculation, this 2 mins was interpreted as 2 sigma or 2 Std Deviations which seems confusing.

99736,"Let me clarify a bit about the hypothesis testing method before I get into the errors part. This will explain the idea of how errors can exist in a hypothesis test. First of all, a hypothesis test doesn't prove whether the statement given by the null hypothesis or the alternate hypothesis is true or not. I think Prof. Tricha has also said this in one of the videos, that you don't prove anything here, you only say that it is a statistically better choice to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the sample conditions. I think the term the Prof used was having "" sufficient evidence from the sample"". The reason why you're not proving anything is that unless and until you check for the entire population, you can never say the population mean is equal to something or not. Let me give an example to make it clear. Let's say that you are conducting a hypothesis test on 10000 cars and you claim that the average mileage of the cars is at least 30 kmpl. Now unless you go and test each and every car's mileage, compute their average and then come to the conclusion that whatever is claimed is true or not, you are not exactly proving the claim statement. Now what hypothesis testing allows us to do is that we can take a small sample of cars, carry out tests on it, calculate its average mileage and then infer whether or not it is a statistically smart move to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. By a statistically smart move, what I mean is that you calculate the values like Zc or Z-score and see if it falls in the critical region or not(if you are using critical value method) or whether its p-value is large enough(if you're using the p-value approach)or not. On the basis of that, you either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. [The Central Limit Theorem that you learnt in Inferential Statistics Module is again another ""statistically smart move"" to infer in what interval the population mean might lie based on the sample mean. You are never sure of whether it is true or not, but you do have a ""confidence level"" to justify it. Whatever you've learnt in Statistics course invariably always boils down to this: "" to use limited information about the sample to predict how the population might behave with a reasonable amount of confidence by using some statistical techniques ""] (Continued below)",313517

93597,"The way SQL assignment was presented required lot of rework. Considering the simplicity of the assignment, lot of hours were wasted in rework. Below are some of my concerns:- 1) It was not mention to have exact column and table names. I used underscore in table and column names, but had to redo entire code. One of the TA mentioned to have same column names and table names only couple of days before 2) Usage of function is also not very clear. We are asked to identify signal in Q3, then what is the point of creating same UDF in Q4? This added lot of confusion. 3) For all other questions, we were asked to create 6 tables one for each stock, but UDF was specific to bajaj. I created a generic function then had to redo to keep it specific for Bajaj.

93156,"First of all, please ensure that you have MySQL version of 8.0 or above. There are a few functionalities which are used in the assignment which are supported only in these versions. Then for importing the csv files: You can follow any process you like to import the data into MySQL. It doesn't have to be a code specifically, you can use the import wizard to do the same. But please make sure you're not skipping any data from the files given, while you're importing them. And remember that, it is enough to do whatever is specified you don't need to import extra data. 1. Creating new tables: Make sure you are creating 6 different tables as mentioned. And the column names should be exactly the same as given(if given) in the problem statement throughout the assignment. 2. Creating the master table: The stocks are taken from the same NSE website for the same time period. So, all the dates should be the same for all the 6 stocks. To create a master table, there have been timeout errors faced by a few of the folks. Make sure you're optimising the process of joining tables here by detailing the code with keys on which the joining has to be done. 3. Buy/Sell/Hold Please understand the concept of Moving Average(50) right. It is important to understand it perfectly to carry out this task. Here, we need to compare MA50 and MA20. Many of you have asked about the first 49/50 rows. Think about it, if we need 50 data points to find an average, can an MA50 be generated for these intital rows? 4. UDF It is mentioned that this process needs to be carried out only for the Bajaj stock. 5. Summary You're expected to answer this according to the analysis you have performed and the results you obtained. Make sure that the conclusion you make regarding the stock data should be backed by the facts obtained from the analysis you carried out. PS: I hope this helps you guys. Good look for the assignment. And of course, I'll be happy to help if you have any other questions apart from the mentioned. :) PPS: Please do not post your questions as comments, you need to ask them on the Discussion Forum as separate questions.

Rest of the days we should HOLD from doing any market trasactions. Per my understanding, the signal should be BUY at golden cross and remain BUY till the next death cross, similarly it should be SELL at death cross and remain SELL till next golden cross and should be HOLD when the 2 averages are close to each other as the future trend is very difficult to predict. Consider a new investor joins the market in an upwords trend, should we signal him to HOLD or BUY, Similarly if he/she joins the market during downward trend, should we signal to HOLD or SELL.

Note: including or excluding non-english speaking countries will change the amount of averages, but the recommendation of 'funding type' does not change.
